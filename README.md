# Graph Visualization with NetworkX  

## Overview  
This project visualizes a simple undirected graph using **NetworkX** and **Matplotlib**. The graph consists of five nodes (`A, B, C, D, E`) with predefined positions and edges connecting specific nodes. The visualization is styled with custom colors, labels, and font settings.  

## Features  
- **Creates an undirected graph** with five nodes and edges.  
- **Customizes node positions** for a clear layout.  
- **Uses Matplotlib for visualization** with formatted labels and colors.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NetworkX** (for graph representation)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)  

## How to Run  
1. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib networkx numpy
   
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python graph_visualization.py

3. A graph will be displayed with labeled nodes and edges.

## Future Improvements
- Add interactive features for dynamic graph editing.
- Implement weighted edges and different layouts.
- Expand to support real-world graph data.
